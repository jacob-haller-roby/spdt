 Call one of the functions here to have it executed when you run `npm start`
 E.g., add `problem1();` to have `npm start` run the `problem1` function from the `problem1.js` file.
 I've added the various problem functions below, but they are currently commented out, so they will not run.
 Simply remove the `//` before one of the problems to un-comment it so that it will execute.

// Since we're now getting into new territories, I've restructured the problems into different folders.
// To run a problem, write the name of the folder, followed by the problem number.  E.g. `Conditionals.problem2();` will

// Conditionals.problem1();
